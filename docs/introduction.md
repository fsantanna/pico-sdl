# pico-sdl documentation
### What is pico-sdl?

pico-sdl is an abstraction layer over SDL2, created by Francisco Sant'Anna and inspired by pico-8. It abstracts lower-level SDL concepts like Renderers and Textures while wrapping its features and extensions (image, ttf, mixer and gfx) into a unified API.

### Building pico-sdl

You have to compile it manually. To do that you need the .c files inside src/ and SDL2 (along with SDL2_image, SDL2_ttf, SDL2_mixer and SDL2_gfx).
